# Modular Workshop

This is a dependency and loader for the revolutionary Modular Workshop system, that allows for modular weapons without the large performance impact that usually accompanies them.

## Benefits of Modular Workshop weapons:
1. Much better performance compared to regular, attachment system based modular weapons.
2. Less clutter in the item spawner.
3. Faster swapping of parts. Build your own personal weapon in no time!
4. Allows anyone to add new skins for weapons. Even vanilla and other modded weapons via the use of the Universal Modular Skin System!
5. Hugely reduced development time for implementers due to the massive reduction of required metadata compared to regular modular weapon mods.

Who said Modular Mods had to be laggy?
